      This is a single page application I built using Vue.js. I wanted to continue developing and sharpening my skills using 
      this frontend framework and decided to add the challenge of including some charts from Charts.js. The information depicted
      in these charts is updated everytime you visit the site through a API call to https://covidtracking.com/.
